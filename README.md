Indian-Car-Analysis
This project revolves around analyzing and visualizing Indian car sales data. Notably, May 2023 saw a significant increase of over 13% in passenger car sales compared to the previous year, with the top 25 selling cars contributing to over 75% of sales in April 2023. 
The dataset consists of 141 columns, and the analysis encompasses both univariate and bivariate techniques. For univariate analysis, steps involve data understanding, cleaning, descriptive statistics, and visualization through histograms, bar charts, box plots, pie charts, and count plots. 
Bivariate analysis entails exploring relationships between variables using correlation matrices, scatter plots, pair plots, bar charts with hue, heatmaps, joint plots, box plots with hue, categorical plots, violin plots, and stacked bar charts. 
The project emphasizes documenting insights and key findings to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and its trends.
